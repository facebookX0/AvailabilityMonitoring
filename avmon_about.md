# About Availability Monitoring
{: #avmon_about}

With {{site.data.keyword.prf_hublong}}, you can create, edit, and view synthetic tests that mimic end-user behavior at your web applications. The {{site.data.keyword.prf_hubshort}} dashboard displays availability and response time information for monitored URLs and APIs grouped by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} region. Use the dashboard to monitor alerts and activities that are associated with your application in different locations by using graphs, breakdown tables, and map views.

This service has the following key features:

- **Get started in less than 5 minutes**. Monitoring features, such as the automatically configured availability test, are available out of the box for applications regardless of where they are running.
- **Maximize uptime and user satisfaction**. Monitor the uptime and response time of your applications for each minute and for several geographical locations. Run synthetic tests to measure the performance of website loading and API calls. Monitor Selenium scripts that you use to mimic user flows from different locations. Use filters to control which dependencies and resources contribute to the response times of your tested web applications, such as third-party metrics. Use triggers to alert you when consecutive failures or threshold breaches take place.
- **Be proactive**. Receive email, Slack, or SMS notifications to alert you to issues before they impact users. You can use the integrated {{site.data.keyword.alertnotificationshort}} service to create alert policies that reduce alert noise.
- **Isolate deployment issues**. To help to isolate issues that occur due to code deployments, you can analyze correlated factors such as response time, availability, and alerts.
- **Identify reasons for failure accurately and quickly**. Waterfall analysis helps you to identify the exact step when a failure occurred and the reason for the failure; for example, broken links, oversized images, slow lookups, or external requests. Screen captures are automatically created to help you to diagnose browser failures and historical performance issues. Download reports of monthly, weekly, and daily availability and response time averages for your tests.
- **Monitor real user satisfaction**. Monitor how satisfied users are with the responsiveness of your application. Compare satisfaction levels with the throughput of your application. Configure data collectors to gather user transaction data from your applications.
